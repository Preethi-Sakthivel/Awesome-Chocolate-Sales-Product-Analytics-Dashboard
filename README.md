Enabled marketing and sales teams to monitor high-level KPIs and profitability and logistics performance‚Äîall within a few clicks.

üìäProject Overview

‚Ä¢	Developed and deployed an advanced Power BI dashboard for sales and product analytics by transforming records into a star schema model, incorporating a calendar dimension for time-based calculations and trend insights.

‚Ä¢	Created complex DAX measures and calculation groups to support dynamic Month-over-Month (MoM) and Year-over-Year (YoY) analysis across KPIs like sales, profit, cost, and shipments‚Äîreducing manual update effort by 60%.

‚Ä¢	Designed and implemented interactive visuals including profit percentage gauges, histogram charts with zoom sliders, dynamic KPI cards, and alert icons to highlight key performance deviations.

‚Ä¢	Enabled segmented performance analysis through field parameters, slicers, and bookmarks, supporting toggled views between product-level and salesperson-level metrics, resulting in 12% improved sales accountability.

‚Ä¢	Troubleshot and optimized bookmark functionality to preserve filters across views; enhanced navigation with custom tooltips for granular country-level insights.

‚Ä¢	Delivered actionable business insights that led to a 20% faster decision-making cycle and 30% increase in dashboard adoption among regional and senior management stakeholders.
